      <dl>
        <dt>The book (published back in 2014) mentions in its menu 4 healthcare-sharing ministries (H.S.M's), which are religious alternatives to health-insurance:</dt>
          <dd>📖 Samaritan Ministries International (S.M.I.), also known as <a href="https://samaritanministries.org/">Samaritan™ Ministries</a></dd>
          <dd>📖 Christian Care Ministry, Inc., or <a href="https://mychristiancare.org/">Christian Care Ministry (C.C.M.)</a></dd>
          <dd>📖 Christian Healthcare Ministries, Inc., or <a href="https://www.chministries.org/">Christian Healthcare Ministries (C.H.M.)</a></dd>
          <dd>📖 Gospel Light Mennonite Church Medical Aid Plan, Inc.'s <a href="https://www.libertyhealthshare.org/">Liberty HealthShare® (L.H.S)</a></dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>With the <cite>S.P.P.</cite> blog-edition, more options came to light:</dt>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://www.medishare.com/">Medi-Share</a> (of C.C.M.)</dd>
          <dd>💻 Altrua Ministries (d.b.a. “Altrua HealthShare</a>”, d.b.a. “<a href="https://altruahealthshare.org/">Altrua SmileShare</a>”)</dd>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://cmfcuro.com/">CURO</a> (specifically-Catholic; of the <a href="https://christmedicus.org/">Christ Medicus Foundation</a>)</dd>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://www.solidarityhealthshare.org/">Solidarity HealthShare®</a> (more Catholic-leaning; of the Melita Christian Fellowship Hospital Aid Plan) with the Solidarity HealthShare Foundation, Inc.</dd>
          <dd>💻 the eventual <cite>S.P.P.</cite>-sponsor <a href="http://thehealthcoop.com/"><s>The Health Co-Op</s></a>, has since exited the market for individual patients(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180808134126/http://thekarisgroup.com/services/karis-health-choice">re-directs to The Karis Group, Inc. since 2018</a>; interestingly serviced/helped-out its former-competitor, <a href="https://go.thekarisgroup.com/resources/case-study-samaritan-ministries">Samaritan™ Ministries</a>, and has been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121012194729/http://www.thehealthcoop.com/health-care-sharing/">Samaritan™-member since 2012</a>.</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <p>Also, a new thing has happened: the creation of the <a href="https://ahcsm.org/">Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries (the Alliance)</a>, whose membership includes 3 of the ministries mentioned in the book (Christian Care Ministry, Samaritan™ Ministries, and Liberty HealthShare®). The Alliance also has 📝 OneShare Health, L.L.C. (<a href="https://www.onesharehealth.com/">OneShare Health®</a>) as a member. (Note: Neither Mr. Pernell nor I have vetted it.)</p>
    <p>An option to consider may also be 📝 CrowdHealth, Inc. (<a href="https://www.joincrowdhealth.com/">CrowdHealth</a>). (Again: Neither Mr. Pernell nor I have vetted it.) I only recently discovered its existence. OneShare Health® is also a new discover to me, but 3 of the vetted ministries have deemed them worthy of membership to the Alliance. No word yet from them about CrowdHealth.</p>

    <h1>Caveat on H.C.S.M.'s, in General:</h1>
    <h2>ALSO: DO YOUR RESEARCH with H.S.M.'s! Some have gotten into legal-trouble, even getting banned from operating in certain States.
      <br>(Also, full disclosure: I've personally been a L.H.S.-member for a decade now.)</h2>
    <p>Now that the caveats have been mentioned, how do H.S.M.'s work?
      <ul>
        <li>Since they're legally NOT INSURANCE, insurance-terms are not be used with them. Hence, each ministry has its own terminology. For example, premiums are't collected by L.H.S.: "monthly contrubutions" are. The said ministry has no insurance-plan with any deductables, but an "Annual Unshared Amount (A.U.M.)" does exist with each level of membership offered.</li>
        <li>The system runs on altruism, mutual-charity, and religious obligaiton, as opposed to legal entitlements.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Has the last point been abused before? You bet! (Recently, <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202109281">bankruptcy was filed</a> by a so-called "Trinity HealthShare" that the Alliance has rightly called a "sham" <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/2022/04/health-care-sharing-ministries-bankrupt-sharity-trinity-unp/">after being found guilty of fraud</a>.) Be careful who gets awarded your money!</p>

    <h1>Caveat on Liberty Healthshare, Specifically:</h1>
    <p>
      <h2>Things have been rocky in L.H.S. with since 2020, and I'd like to compare notes with members of other H.S.M.'s, if possible. How are thing in your ministry?</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Taking the numbers reported in the members' e-mail newsletters and squeezing as much as I can from them on spreadsheets, I got this:</dt>
          <dd>● When I joined in 2014, contribtuions & shared bills were practically 1:1, and just under $60k per month. In just 1 year, that jumped to $1mil. We, the membership, were healthy & health-conscious people. BUT mainstream news-media started catching-on and raising awareness of H.S.M.'s existence. Wider society joined en masse! By 2016, $5mil was normal for L.H.S.'s monthly revenue from July onward. It was 2017, when the troubles began, with multi-million dollar monthly deficits appearing every do often. Not a problem, apparently, since monthly contributions of $20mil were starting, too. Big money! What could possibly go wrong? By 2018, the monthly-rate was hiked by June (AFTER deficits of $10mil & approaching were added to monthly deficits), so contribution did jump to the 1x-maximum of $48mil by December. For 2019, monthly revenue averaged $30mil, it seemed progress was made to address the backlog… And then, COVID attacked! From 2020-2021, the contrubution-rate was raised again, top-leadership was replaced, and the membership-offerings were overhauled. The year 2022 was the year debt-elimination was on the forefront. By September 2024, 74% of the backlog was paid-off. As of December 2024, no furhter updates on paying-off the debt has been issued. (WHY‽) Also, monthly contributions have dropped to just below $12mil/month. (sigh)</dd>
          <dd>● So if you've read/heard of (current/former) L.H.S.-members complaining of unpaid expenses, this is why: the L.H.S. took-in too many high-expense new-members and failed to raise the monthly contrubution-rate accordingly. Also, a newsletter reported disingenuous "pump & dump"-members, who left directly after incurring and reporting heavy medical-bills. Then, there are reports like <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-healthshare-beers-family-insurance-ppp-ohio">this</a> & <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-healthshare-healthcare-sharing-ministries-obamacare">this</a>. How much of it is real, and how much of it is a smear-campaign from the insurance-industry, which would certainly benefit from the elimination of insurance-alternatives?</dd>
          <dd>● Personally, I'm healthy: I barely really need the routine, annual checkups. That said, my medical-bills have ALWAYS been paid from 2014 to today (late-2024), or I would have dropped my membership long ago! God willing, L.H.S.'s new leadership will continue the course of reforms & backlog-burning, so that the ministry will be debt-free by the end of 2025! 🙏</dd>
          <dd>● If you're a member of another H.S.M. (whether listed here or not), wen did you join and how have things been with your ministry so far?</dd>
