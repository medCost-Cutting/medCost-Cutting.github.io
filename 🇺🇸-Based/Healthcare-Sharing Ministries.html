        <dt>The book (published back in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>) mentions in its menu 4 <abbr>H.S.M's</abbr>, which are religious alternatives to health-insurance:</dt>

    <section>
      <dl>
        <dt>With the <cite>S.P.P.</cite> blog-edition, more options came to light:</dt>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://www.medishare.com/"><strong>Medi-Share</strong></a> (of prior-mentioned <abbr>C.C.M.</abbr>), with their <a href="https://mychristiancare.org/medi-share/what-is-medishare/how-medi-share-works/medi-share-guidelines/">Medi-Share Guidelines</a></dd>
          <dd>💻 <strong>Altrua Ministries</strong> (<abbr>d.b.a.</abbr> “<a href="https://altruahealthshare.org/"><strong>Altrua HealthShare</strong></a>”, <abbr>d.b.a.</abbr> “<strong>Altrua SmileShare</strong>”), with their <a href="https://altruahealthshare.org/resources/guidelines/">Membership Guidelines</a></dd>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://cmfcuro.com/"><strong>CURO</strong></a> (specifically-Catholic; of the <a href="https://christmedicus.org/">Christ Medicus Foundation</a>), which does "<a href="https://cmfcuro.com/sharing/">partner with Samaritan Ministries International</a> (<abbr>S.M.I.</abbr>)" and, hence, uses Samaritan™ Guidelines for Sharing in Classic/Basic</dd>
          <dd>💻 <a href="https://www.solidarityhealthshare.org/"><strong>Solidarity HealthShare®</strong></a> (more Catholic-leaning; of the Melita Christian Fellowship Hospital Aid Plan, with the Solidarity HealthShare Foundation, <abbr>Inc.</abbr>), with their <a href="https://solidarityhealthshare.org/sharing-guidelines/">Sharing Guidelines</a></dd>
          <dd>💻 The eventual <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite>-sponsor <a href="http://thehealthcoop.com/"><s><strong>The Health Co-Op</strong></s></a>, has since exited the market for individual patients (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180808134126/http://thekarisgroup.com/services/karis-health-choice">re-directs to The Karis Group, <abbr>Inc.</abbr> since <time datetime="2018">2018</time></a>); interestingly serviced/helped-out its former-competitor, <a href="https://go.thekarisgroup.com/resources/case-study-samaritan-ministries">Samaritan™ Ministries</a>, and has been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121012194729/http://www.thehealthcoop.com/health-care-sharing/">Samaritan™-member since <time datetime="2012">2012</time></a>.

      </dl>
      <p>Also, a new thing has happened: the creation of the <a href="https://ahcsm.org/">Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries (<abbr title="Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries">the Alliance</abbr>)</a>, whose membership includes 3 of the ministries mentioned in the book (Christian Care Ministry, Samaritan™ Ministries, and Liberty HealthShare®). <abbr>The Alliance</abbr> also has 📝 <strong>OneShare Health, <abbr title="Limited Liability Company">L.L.C.</abbr></strong> (<a href="https://www.onesharehealth.com/"><strong><abbr title="OneShare Health, L.L.C.">OneShare Health</abbr>®</strong></a>) as a member. (Note: Neither Mr. Pernell nor I have vetted it.)</p>
      <p>An option to consider may also be 📝 <strong>CrowdHealth, <abbr>Inc.</abbr></strong> (<a href="https://www.joincrowdhealth.com/"><strong><abbr title="CrowdHealth, Inc.">CrowdHealth</abbr></strong></a>). (Again: Neither Mr. Pernell nor I have vetted it.) I only recently discovered its existence. <abbr>OneShare Health</abbr>® is also a new discover to me, but 3 of the vetted ministries have deemed them worthy of membership to the Alliance. No word yet from them about <abbr>CrowdHealth</abbr>.</p>

      <h1>Considerations for Selectng from <abbr>H.S.M.'s</abbr></h1>
      <p><strong>Read the guidelines!</strong> If you assume they're identical to insurance (except on a religious framework), disappointments (& maybe even financial-disaster) reaching you may prove otherwise. Also, <strong>treatment of pre-existing conditions will vary</strong>.</p>
      <p>Considering the religious nature of (genuine, good-faith) <abbr>H.C.S.M.'s</abbr> (and given the ministries' target-audience are mostly practicing Christians), <strong>medical-expenses from violations of generally-accepted Christian morals</strong> (<abbr title="for example">ex.</abbr> from committing illegal activity, drug-abuse, intoxication, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>)… <strong>are not likely to be considered</strong>. Abortions, sterilization, contraception, and the like are also unlikely to be considered. (For specifics on each ministry, <strong>read the guidelines</strong>.) <strong>Some require regular church-attendance</strong>, with a minister's affidavit to certify this. (Personally, I know <abbr>L.H.S.</abbr> does not. Also, check the others, for more options.) <strong>Requiring members to live by conservative values</strong> (<abbr>ex.</abbr> avoiding substance-abuse, promiscuity, <abbr>etc.</abbr>) also serves serves another purpose: lowering medical-expenses (<abbr>ex.</abbr> avoiding expenses from chronic drug-abuse on the body, sexually-transmitted diseases, <abbr>etc.</abbr>).</p>
      <p>As of <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite> book-edition's wwriting (back in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>), NONE of the 4 book-listed ministries ever failed to pay an eligible bill (back when <abbr>H.S.M.'s</abbr> were little-known and the memberships were mostly healthy and/or health-conscious). As can be seen from online-reviews after that year, the masive influx of the rest of the population when it became more popularized ended this. For certain, different <abbr>H.C.S.M.'s</abbr> have been coping, adjusting, and trying to recover from this. (More on that below.)</p>

      <h1>Caveat on <abbr>H.C.S.M.'s</abbr>, in General:</h1>
      <h2>ALSO: DO YOUR RESEARCH with <abbr>H.S.M.'s</abbr>! Some have gotten into legal-trouble, even getting banned from operating in certain States.
        <br>(Also, full disclosure: I've personally been a <abbr>L.H.S.</abbr>-member for a decade now.)</h2>
      <p>Now that the caveats have been mentioned, how do <abbr>H.S.M.'s</abbr> work?
        <ul>
          <li>Since <span class="underline">they're legally NOT INSURANCE</span>, <span class="underline">insurance-terms are not be used with them</span>. <strong>Hence, <span class="underline">each ministry</span> has its own terminology.</strong> For example, premiums are't collected by <abbr>L.H.S.</abbr>: "monthly contrubutions" are. Medical expenses are "shared", not covered. The said ministry has no insurance-plan with any deductables, but an "Annual Unshared Amount (<abbr title="Annual Unshared Amount">A.U.M.</abbr>)" does exist with each level of membership offered.</li>
          <li>The system runs on altruism, mutual-charity, and religious obligaiton, as opposed to legal entitlements.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Has the last point been abused before? You bet! (Recently, <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202109281">bankruptcy was filed</a> by a so-called "Trinity HealthShare" that <abbr>the Alliance<abbr> has rightly called a "sham" <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/2022/04/health-care-sharing-ministries-bankrupt-sharity-trinity-unp/">after being found guilty of fraud</a>.) Be careful who gets awarded your hard-earned money!</p>

      <h1>Caveat on Liberty Healthshare, Specifically:</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Things have been rocky in <abbr>L.H.S.</abbr> with since <strong><time datetime="2020">2020</time></strong>, and I'd like to compare notes with members of other <abbr>H.S.M.'s</abbr>, if possible. How are thing in your ministry?</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Taking the numbers reported in the members' e-mail newsletters and squeezing as much as I can from them on spreadsheets, I got this:</dt>
            <dd>● When I joined in <strong><time datetime="2014">2014</time></strong>, <span class="underline">contributions & shared bills were practically <abbr title="1 is to 1">1:1</abbr></span>, and just under <abbr title="$60,000">$60k</abbr> per month. In just 1 year, that jumped to <abbr title="$1,000,000">$1mil</abbr>. We, the membership, were healthy & health-conscious people. BUT mainstream news-media started catching-on and raising awareness of <abbr>H.S.M.'s</abbr> existence. Wider society joined en masse!
              <br>By <strong><time datetime="2016">2016</time></strong>, <abbr title="$5,000,000">$5mil</abbr> was normal for <abbr>L.H.S.</abbr>'s monthly revenue from <time datetime="2016-07">July</time> onward.
              <br>It was <strong><time datetime="2017">2017</time></strong>, when the <strong>troubles began</strong>, with <span class="underline">multi-million dollar monthly deficits appearing every do often</span>. Not a problem, apparently, since monthly contributions of <abbr title="$20,000,000">$20mil</abbr> were starting, too. Big money! What could possibly go wrong?
              <br>By <strong><time datetime="2018">2018</time></strong>, the <span class="underline">monthly-rate was hiked</span> by <time datetime="2018-06">June</time> (AFTER deficits of <abbr title="$10,000,000">$10mil</abbr> & approaching were added to monthly deficits), so contribution did jump to the <abbr title="1-time">1x</abbr>-maximum of <abbr title="$48,000,000">$48mil</abbr> by December.
              <br>For <strong><time datetime="2019">2019</time></strong>, monthly revenue averaged <abbr tille="$30,000,000">$30mil</abbr>, it <span class="underline">seemed progress was made to address the backlog</span>… And then, <strong><abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID</abbr> attacked!</strong>
              <br>From <strong><time datetime="2020">2020</time>-<time datetime="2021">2021</time></strong>, the <span class="underline">contrubution-rate was raised</span> again, <span class="underline">top-leadership was replaced</span>, and the <span class="underline">membership-offerings were overhauled</span>.
              <br>The year <strong><time datetime="2022">2022</time></strong> was the year <span class="underline">debt-elimination was on the forefront</span>.
              <br>By <strong><time datetime="2024-09">September 2024</time></strong>, <strong>74% of the backlog was paid-off</strong>. As of <time datetime="2024-12">December 2024</time>, <span class="underline">no furhter updates on paying-off the debt</span> has been issued. (WHY‽) Also, monthly contributions have dropped to just below <abbr title="$12,000,000 per month">$12mil/month</abbr>. (sigh)</dd>
            <dd>● So <strong>if you've read/heard of (current/former) <abbr>L.H.S.</abbr>-members complaining of unpaid expenses, this is why</strong>: the <abbr>L.H.S.</abbr> took-in too many high-expense new-members and failed to raise the monthly contrubution-rate accordingly. Also, a newsletter reported disingenuous "pump & dump"-members, who left directly after incurring and reporting heavy medical-bills. Then, there are reports like <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-healthshare-beers-family-insurance-ppp-ohio">this</a> & <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-healthshare-healthcare-sharing-ministries-obamacare">this</a>. How much of it is real, and how much of it is a smear-campaign from the insurance-industry, which would certainly benefit from the elimination of insurance-alternatives?</dd>
            <dd>● Personally, I'm healthy: I barely really need the routine, annual checkups. That said, my medical-bills have ALWAYS been paid from <time datetime="2014">2014</time> to today (early-<time datetime="2024">2024</time>), or I would have dropped my membership long ago! God willing, <abbr>L.H.S.</abbr>'s new leadership will continue the course of reforms & backlog-burning, so that the ministry will be debt-free by the end of <time datetime="2025">2025</time>! 🙏</dd>
            <dd>● <strong>If you're a member of another <abbr title="healthcare-sharing ministry">H.S.M.</abbr></abbr></strong> (whether listed here or not), <strong>when did you join</strong> and <strong>how have things been with your ministry so far?</strong></dd>
