      <p>Want to pay the <strong>discounted</strong> prices the insurance-companies pay, instead of paying the full price? You can buy into that! As said in the 2014-published book: 
      <blockquote>
        <p>Most sellers of medical discount cards are independent businesses that buy their access to discounted prices through insurance companies, although some insurance companies including Assurant and Blue Cross / Blue Shield also sell medical discount cards.</p>
        <p>Most medical discount plans include a wide range of health providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, pharmacy benefits, dental, and vision care. Some plans are limited to pharmacy, dental, vision, and chiropractic providers.</p>
        <p>The savings can be substantial for the uninsured (people with high-deductable plans already have access to the discounted prices and don't need medical discount cards), often rangingbetween 20 and 40 percent depending on the provoder and services. While prices and plans vary from company to company, medical discount cards typically involve payment of $25 or more.</p>
        <p>People considering using a medical discount plan should be aware that the industry has a problem with poor quality and fraud from some companies. Typical problems include providers not accepting plans, out-of-date information, deceptive marketing practices that confuse peopleinto thinking they are buying insurnace, and fly-by-night scams in which people buy worthless plans.</p>
      </blockquote></p>
      <p>To combat the issues in the latter paragraph, California's <a href="https://healthconsumer.org">Health Consumer Alliance</a> ("Funded by generous support from The California Endowment, the <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/">California Department of Managed Health Care</a>, Covered California, and the Blue Shield Foundation.") setup a trade-association to establish industry best--practices, and collaborate with regulators & State attorneys-general in safeguardng the industry.</p>
      <p>To be safe, research with <a href="https://www.bbb.org/bbb-directory">your local International Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (Better Business Bureau®)</a>, <a href="https://www.usa.gov/state-attorney-general">your State's attorney-general's website</a>, and/or <a href="https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer">your State's consumer-protection agency's website</a>.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, the blog did not have a "discount-plan"-section, so all these entries are ALL from the book. (As may be noticed, some are dental-related. A "Dental Care"-page is underway with more details.)</p>
