      <summary>Introduction</summary>
      <p>Want to <strong>pay the discounted prices the insurance-companies pay</strong>, instead of paying the full price? You can <strong>buy into that</strong>! As said in the <time datetime="2014">2014</time>-published book (in p.53-54), with <strong>my emphasis added</strong>:
      <blockquote>
        <p>Most sellers of medical discount cards are independent businesses that buy their access to discounted prices through insurance companies, although some insurance companies including Assurant and Blue Cross / Blue Shield also sell medical discount cards.</p>
        <p>Most medical discount plans include a <strong>wide range of health providers</strong>, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, pharmacy benefits, dental, and vision care. Some plans are limited to pharmacy, dental, vision, and chiropractic providers.</p>
        <p>The <strong>savings can be substantial for the uninsured</strong> (<strong>people with high-deductable plans already have access to the discounted prices</strong> and <strong>don't need medical discount cards</strong>), <strong>often ranging between 20 and 40 percent</strong> depending on the provoder and services. While prices and plans vary from company to company, medical discount cards typically involve payment of $25 or more.</p>
        <p>People considering using a medical discount plan should be aware that <strong>the industry has a problem with poor quality and fraud</strong> from some companies. Typical problems include providers not accepting plans, out-of-date information, deceptive marketing practices that confuse peopleinto thinking they are buying insurnace, and fly-by-night scams in which people buy worthless plans.</p>
      </blockquote></p>
      <p>To combat the issues in the latter paragraph, California's <a href="https://healthconsumer.org" tabindex="01">Health Consumer Alliance</a> ("Funded by generous support from The California Endowment, the <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/" tabindex="02">California Department of Managed Health Care</a>, Covered California, and the Blue Shield Foundation.") setup a trade-association to establish industry best--practices, and collaborate with regulators & State attorneys-general in safeguardng the industry.</p>
      <p>To be safe, <strong>research with <a href="https://www.bbb.org/bbb-directory" tabindex="03">your local International Association of Better Business Bureaus, <abbr title="Incorporation">Inc.</abbr> (<abbr title="International Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc.">Better Business Bureau</abbr>®)</a>, <a href="https://www.usa.gov/state-attorney-general" tabindex="04">your State's attorney-general's website</a>, and/or <a href="https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer" tabindex="05">your State's consumer-protection agency's website</a></strong>.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the <strong><cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite>-blog did not have a "discount-plan"-section</strong>, so <strong>all these entries are ALL from the book</strong>. (As may be noticed, some are dental-related. A "Dental Care"-page is underway with more details.)</p>
