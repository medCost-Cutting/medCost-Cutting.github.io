    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The <time datetime="2014">2014</time>-published <cite>S.P.P.</cite> book-edion (in p.67-68) says, with <bold>my emphasis added</bold>:</p>
     <blockquote>
       In recent years, as <strong>the phenomenon of hospitals chargin outlandish pries to uninsured patients has come to the attenion of the media</strong>, more and <strong>more hospitals are recognizing the need to give a fair and reasonable price to patients who are payng for their own care</strong>.
       <br>While not as helpful as posting prices, <strong>many hospitals have begun to offer substantial discounts off their chargemaster prices</strong>. <a href="https://www.elcaminohealth.org/">El Camino Hospital</a> in <a href="https://www.getcare.elcaminohealth.org/locations">Silicon Valley</a>, says that they offer automatic 75 percent off of their bill for patients who pay in full at the time of serrvice (which should give you some idea of how madly they inflate their prices to begin with). <a href="https://www.bswhealth.com/">Baylor Healh Systems</a>, with several hospitals in Texas, offers a 35 percent discount to uninsured patients. Both offer written estimates for the cost of many procedures, although the price is not binding and may be higher or lower in the end.
       <br>In some cases, <strong>your doctor may be able to help you negotiate a cash price</strong> for your treatment at a local hospital. You can also <strong>call the hospital billing department directly</strong>, and <strong>explain that you are a self-pay patient</strong> and <strong>ask how much</strong> a particular procedure will cost to have performed at their facility (remember, <strong>this probably won't include the surgeon's or treating doctor's fee</strong>).
       <br>Having a rough idea of what the hospital typically charges insurance companies for similar treatment can be extremely helpful in these circumstances. The <a href="https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/">Health Care Blue Book</a>, described in the previous chapter, can be a good source for this information.

    <p>Wow! And I thought the mental-health market was fierce. So many have exited (or "now seem to no longer relevant to") the medical-bill negotiation-market since <cite>S.P.P.</cite>-blog went offline, back in early <time datetime="2021">2021</time>.</p>
    <p>Whether you </p>
