    <div>As per Mr. Sean Parnell's "<span class="title">Self-Pay Project</span> (<span class="title">S.P.P.</span>)"-blog:
      <blockquote cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308044505/http://selfpaypatient.com/selfpayhealthcaremarket/">
        <h1>Welcome to the Self-Pay Healthcare Market!</h1>
        <h2>The following is a partial list of providers, facilities, web sites, and other companies and organizations that cater to or at least are especially helpful to self-pay patients. The list is definitely incomplete, as I continue to discover new options for self-pay patients I will add to the list. If you have any recommendations to add to the list, please send me an e-mail at selfpaypatient@gmail.com!</h2>

    <p>Back in 2014, Mr. Parnell published the book, <span class="title">The Self-Pay Patient: Affordable Healthcare Choices in the Age of Obamacare</span> (in <a href=“https://www.amazon.com/dp/0991209400">paperback</a> & <a href=“https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HBUPLFG”>e-book</a>). And since books get outdated on printing, he also setup and managed & the now-late, great (just-cited) <a href=“https://selfpaypatient.com/”>blog</a>, where people could share their own cost-cutting discoveries & how it worked for them. These would be added, and the listing became even more comprehensive!</p>
    <p>With medical-costs where they are now, would't it be great we had an updated list for now (2025 & beyond)?</p>
    <p>Well, this is my attempt.</p>
    <p>As can be imagined, there's a lot of back-tracking to do. Of course, that won't stop me from adding my own discoveries, too. (Options from the books will have "📖" on it, while "💻" will be on the blog-listed entries. My own will have "📝" on them.) Tallying everything together, the <span class="title">S.P.P.</span>'s menu included 296 options: 194 book-exclusive + 102 new, in-blog. How many are still available to us today? Let's see!</p>
    <p>Yeah, med_Cost-Cutting is still in its initial phases. (Sorry for the flaws!) It will improve (God willing it). Mr. Parnell’s groundbreaking project was U.S.-based. I eventually hope to extend this worldwide, since EVERYONE needs affordable healthcare. Let’s see how Lord <span class="god" lang=“he-IL”>יהוה</span> leads.</p>
    <p>Status: Re-establishing a new website.</p>
