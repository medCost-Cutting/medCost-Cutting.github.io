          <p class="center"><strong>Have you ever been frustrated by an unproductive or inopportune visit with your doctor that wasted your time and money?
            <br>You can prevent that from happening again!</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The Problem</strong>
            <br>Many visits with healthcare providers are poorly timed and less productive than they could be. Why? Because <strong>nobody is looking out for you between visits</strong>.
            <br>It‚Äôs not that your doctor doesn‚Äôt care.  He or she is simply too busy with clinical tasks to be able to optimize your visits.</p>
          <p><strong>As a result, you spend more money and get suboptimal care:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Extra visits and additional costs at the pharmacy.</li>
              <li>Incorrect or unnecessary testing and treatment.</li>
              <li>Rushed decisions and explanations.</li>
              <li>Some visits are so handicapped by poor planning that they accomplish nothing, wasting both your time and money.</li>
            </ul></p>
          <p class="center"><strong>It is easy to minimize the number of visits and maximize the time with your doctor.
            <br>Read on to find out how.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The Solution</strong>
            <br>You can easily accomplish more for less cost at the doctor‚Äôs office with what I call <strong>SMART Preparation</strong>. Each letter relates to an aspect of your visit that you might improve upon with a little thought and preparation: <strong>S</strong>cheduling, <strong>M</strong>edications, <strong>A</strong>genda, <strong>R</strong>ecords and <strong>T</strong>ests.
            <br><strong>The exercise will only take a minute or two and will pay off every time.</strong></p>
          <p><strong class="center">Scheduling</strong>
            <br class="center">Optimize visit timing and duration.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Most important:</strong> When making the appointment, inform the receptionist of <strong>EVERY issue that you need to cover</strong> so that adequate time is scheduled.  If you think of additional topics to be addressed, call back to allow a previously scheduled visit to be extended.</li>
              <li><strong>Schedule visits just before medications refills are due</strong> to avoid wasting purchased prescriptions.</li>
              <li><strong>Using a mail-order pharmacy?</strong> Allow time for shipping to avoid expensive local refills.</li>
              <li><strong>Space out visits</strong> to different healthcare providers to avoid redundant care.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
