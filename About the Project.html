      <article>As per Mr. Sean Parnell's <cite>Self-Pay Patient</cite> (<cite>(abbr title="Self-Pay Patient">S.P.P.</cite>) blog-edition:
        <blockquote cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308044505/http://selfpaypatient.com/selfpayhealthcaremarket/">
          <h1>Welcome to the Self-Pay Healthcare Market!</h1>
          <h2>The following is a partial list of providers, facilities, web sites, and other companies and organizations that cater to or at least are especially helpful to self-pay patients. The list is definitely incomplete, as I continue to discover new options for self-pay patients I will add to the list. If you have any recommendations to add to the list, please send me an e-mail at selfpaypatient@gmail.com!</h2>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Back in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, Mr. Parnell published the book, <a href=“https://www.amazon.com/dp/0991209400"><cite>The Self-Pay Patient: Affordable Healthcare Choices in the Age of Obamacare<cite></a> (<cite><abbr title="The Self-Pay Patient: Affordable Healthcare Choices in the Age of Obamacare">S.P.P.</abbr></cite>). And since books get outdated on printing, he also setup and managed & the now-late, great (just-cited) <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite> <a href=“https://selfpaypatient.com/”>blog</a>-edition, where people could share their own cost-cutting discoveries & how it worked for them. These would be added, and the listing ("The Self-Pay Healthcare Market") would become even MORE comprehensive!</p>
        <p>This ever-improving menu continued developing and expanding… until <time datetime="2021">2021</time>-<time datetime="2022">2022</time>. Then, it (unfortunately) vanished.</p>
        <p>With medical-costs where they are now, would't it be great we had an updated list for now (<time datetime="2025">2025</time> & beyond)?</p>
        <p>Well, this is my attempt.</p>

      <h1><cite>Project: "med_Cost-Cutting"</cite> Introduction</h1>
      <p>As can be imagined, there's A LOT of back-tracking to do: an impressive (& daunting) 296 options, if my count is correct. Of course, that won't stop me from adding my own discoveries, too.
        <dl>
          <dt>On Icons & Information-Sources</dt>
            <dd>The <strong>194 (<span class="underline">options from the <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite> book-edition will have "📖"</span></strong> on it.</dd>
            <dd>The <strong>102 <span class="underline">options listed in the <cite><abbr>S.P.P.</abbr></cite> blod-edition will have "💻"</span></strong> on them.</dd>
            <dd><strong><span class="underline">My own will have "📝"</span></strong> on them.</dd>
          <dt>On Icons of Government-Options</dt>
            <dd>Whether from Mr. Parnell or me, <span class="underline">U.S. Federal and/or State government-provided options have "🇺🇸"</span> on them.</dd>
            <dd><span class="underline">My added Philippine government-provided options will have "🇵🇭"</span>, instead.</dd>
            <dd><span class="underline">Whatever other relevant government's flag</span> will be on options for whatever other jurisdiction will be included in this project in the future.</dd>
        </dl>
        How many of these (over 300!) options are still available to us today? Let's see!
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, <cite>med_Cost-Cutting</cite> is still in its initial phases. (Sorry for the flaws!) It will improve (God willing it). Mr. Parnell’s groundbreaking project was U.S.-based. I eventually hope to extend this worldwide, since EVERYONE needs affordable healthcare. Let’s see how Lord <span class="god" lang=“he-IL”>יהוה</span> leads.</p>
