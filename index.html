      <h1>Status Report</h1>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> 51 of 308 Options Listed.
        <br>(<strong>29 book-listed options</strong>, 24 of which seem current; <strong>11 blog-listed</strong>, of which 5 seem current; <strong>plus 11 added by me</strong>; <strong>therefore, 51 listed</strong>, of which 40 seem current)
        <br>All the re-branding-related back-tracking from my project's original form is completed. (In fact, the page now has MORE opions listed to date, than it did just before the overhaul!) So, there's only 1 direction now, and that's "Forward!" 😆 Let's go!
      </p>
      <p><strong>Current Objectives:</strong> Fill-in more pages with more options.</p>
      <p>This new website is still under construction! Please, stay tuned! There's A LOT to come!</p>

      <br>I CAN BE WRONG, so please also DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, to be safe. I try my best to avoid mistakes, but I am human.
