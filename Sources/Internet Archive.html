  <h1 class="center">The "<cite>Self-Pay Patient</cite>" Blog-Edition, as Saved by the Internet Archive</h1>
  <p>Mr. Pranell's "<cite>Self-Pay Patient</cite>"-website was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/https://selfpaypatient.com/">saved</a> 131 times between (Monday) <time datetime="2013-12-16">16 December 2013</time> & (Thursday) <time datetime="2024-08-08">08 August 2024</time>, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org"><cite>Internet Archive</cite> (a.k.a. "The <cite>Wayback Machine</cite>")</a>.</p>
  <p>This <cite>Wayback Machine</cite>-record is the most complete source detected (as of yet). From it, it's derived that the info-rich site was a blog from around <time datetime="2013-12">December 2013</time> ‚Äì <time datetime="2021-02">February 2021</time>, before switching to a non-blog website from <time datetime="2021-08">August 2021</time> ‚Äì <time datetime="2022-10">October 2022</time>, when it finally went offline.</p>
  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308044505/http://selfpaypatient.com/">The latest, functional listing</a> dates back to <time datetime="2021-02-24 17:39">2021.02.24Wed.17:39:24h</time>, and will serve as a major source of info here. All other info provided will probably update and/or suppliment what was provided there, with some replacing what has already exited the market.</p>
