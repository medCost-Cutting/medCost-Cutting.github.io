  <p>This Wayback Machine record is the most complete source detected (as of yet). From it, it's derived that the info-rich site was a blog from around <time datetime="2013-12">December 2013</time> ‚Äì <time datetime="2021-02">February 2021</time>, before switching to a non-blog website from <time datetime="2021-08">August 2021</time> ‚Äì <time datetime="2022-10">October 2022</time>, when it finally went offline.</p>
  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308044505/http://selfpaypatient.com/">The latest, functional listing</a> dates back to <time datetime="2021-02-24 17:39">2021.02.24Wed.17:39:24h</time>, and will serve as a major source of info here. All other info provided will probably update and/or suppliment what was provided there, with some replacing what has already exited the market.</p>
