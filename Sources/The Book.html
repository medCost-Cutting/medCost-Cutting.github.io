<body>
  <p>As mentioned earlier, <span class="title">The Self-Pay Patient: Affordable Healthcare Choices in the Age of Obamacare</span> comes in both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0991209400">paperback</a> & <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HBUPLFG">e-book formats</a>. I have the paperback, and will probably quote it. Ideally, I whould be able to note what options are on the book, what was added on the website, and what has changed since.</p>
