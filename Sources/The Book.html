  <h1 class="center">The "<cite>Self-Pay Patient</cite>" Book-Edition</h1>
  <p>As mentioned earlier, <cite>The Self-Pay Patient: Affordable Healthcare Choices in the Age of Obamacare</cite> comes in both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0991209400">paperback</a> & <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HBUPLFG">e-book formats</a>. I have the paperback, and will probably quote it. Ideally, I whould be able to note what options are on the book, what was added on the website, and what has changed since.</p>

    <p>DISCLAIMER: This is NOT professional advice. I am just a high-functioning autistic info-junkie with an amateur research & data-aggregation hobby, as well as a desire to help people.
      <br>I CAN BE WRONG, so please also DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, to be safe. I try my best to avoid mistakes, but I am human.
      <br>Hence, I welcome any constructive info that can help improve the listing.</p>
