    <summary><strong>On Health-Insurance</strong></summary>
      <p>Back in the Philippines ("<abbr title="Philippines">PHL</abbr>" or "<abbr title="Philippines">PH</abbr>"), the "<a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2019/02/20/republic-act-no-11223/" tabindex="01"><cite>Universal Health Care Act</cite></a>" (<a href="https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/86448" tabindex="02">Republic Act 11223</a>) became law on <time datetime="2019-02-21">21 February 2019</time>. So while <strong>private health-insurace options do exist</strong>, all Philippine citizens are declared to be members of the government owned or controlled corporation (<abbr title="government owned or controlled corporation">G.O.C.C.</abbr>) 📝 <a href="https://www.philhealth.gov.ph/" tabindex="03"><strong>Philippine Health Insurance Corp.</strong> ("<strong><abbr title="Philippine Health Insurance Corp.">PhilHealth</abbr></strong>" or "<strong><abbr title="Philippine Health Insurance Corp.">P.H.I.C.</abbr></strong>")</a>, under the <a href="https://doh.gov.ph/" tabindex="04">Department of Health (<abbr title="Department of Health">D.O.H.</abbr>)</a>. Of course, laws are more easily made than implemented, in a non-1st-world republic with a limited budget to administer <a href="https://www.gov.ph/the-philippines-3/" tabindex="05">7,641</a> to 2,000-ish islands (depending on hightide or lowtide).</p>
      <p>To fill-in the gaps, the <a href="https://www.dswd.gov.ph/" tabindex="07">Department of Social Welfare & Development (<abbr title="Department of Social Welfare & Development" tabindex="08">D.S.W.D.</abbr>)</a> hosts 📝 "<a href="https://aics.dswd.gov.ph/malasakit-centers/"><span lang="fil-PH" class="italic"><strong>Malasakit</span> Centers</strong></a>" to provide further financial-support/"Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations (<abbr title="Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations">A.I.C.S.</abbr>)", as best it can. The term <span lang="fil-PH">ᜋᜎᜐᜃᜒᜆ᜔</span> ("<span lang="fil-PH" class="italic">malasákit</span>"; "mah-lah-SAH-kit"; <abbr title="noun">n.</abbr>「sympathy」) comes from the root-word <span lang="fil-PH">ᜐᜃᜒᜆ᜔</span>, which can mean either one thing ("<span lang="fil-PH" class="italic">sákit</span>"; "SAH-kit"; <abbr>n.</abbr>「empathy/sympathy」) or another ("<span lang="fil-PH" class="italic">sakít</span>"; "sah-KIT"; <abbr>n.</abbr> 「pain/sickness/condition」).</p>

    <summary><strong>On Traditional, Alternative, and Complementary Medicine</strong></summary>
    <p>The <a href="https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/3840" tabindex="09">“<cite>Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act (<abbr title="Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act">TAMA</abbr>) of 1997</cite>” (<abbr title="Republic Act">R.A.</abbr> 8423)</a> was signed into law on <time datetime="1997-12-09">9 December 1997</time>, creating the <a href="https://pitahc.gov.ph/about-pitahc/" tabindex="10">Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (<abbr title="Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care">P.I.T.A.H.C.</abbr>)</a>, another <abbr>G.O.C.C.</abbr>, also under the <abbr>D.O.H.</abbr> As of <time datetime="2025-01-13">13 January 2025</time>, there are 📝 <strong>1,527 <a href="https://pitahc.gov.ph/list-of-certified-practitioners/" tabindex="11">listed <abbr>P.I.T.A.H.C.</abbr>-certified practitioners</strong></a> & 📝 <strong>119 <a href="https://pitahc.gov.ph/list-of-accredited-facilities-organizations/" tabindex="12">listed <abbr>P.I.T.A.H.C.</abbr>-accredited facilities/organizations</strong></a>.</p>

    <summary><strong>On Medical Tourism</strong></summary>
    <p>A note: While medical-tourism to the <abbr>PHL</abbr> is a thing (and here's a <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/philippines-healthcare" tabindex="13">write-up about it from the <abbr title="United States of America">U.S.</abbr> Department of Commerce</a>), it's generally most advisable to seek treatment from facilities inside the National Capital Region ("<abbr title="National Capital Region">N.C.R.</abbr>", <abbr title="also known as">a.k.a.</abbr> "Metro Manila"), like from 📝 <a href="https://www.stlukes.com.ph/international-patients/about-stlukes" tabindex="14"><strong>St. Luke's Medical Center (<abbr title="Saint Luke's Medical Center">S.L.M.C.</abbr>)</strong></a>, or in specilaist-centers in major-cities. Healthcare services in far-flung provincial areas may prove very basic.</p>

    <summary><strong>On Telemedicine (for Filipinos, Domestic & Abroad)</strong></summary>
    <strong>Basic Information</strong>
    <p>Metro Pacific Investments Corp.'s 📝 "<a href="https://www.mwell.com.ph/" tabindex="15"><strong>mWell <abbr>PH</abbr></strong></a>"-application (<abbr title="application">app</abbr>) has a <a href="https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/04/04/entertainment-lifestyle/life-times/health-app-govt-partner-for-ofws-global-healthcare/1885552" tabindex="16">partnership</a> with the <a href="https://dmw.gov.ph/" tabindex="17">Department of Migrant Workers (<abbr title="Department of Migrant Workers">D.M.W.</abbr>)</a> to ensure Filipinos EVERYWHERE can get affordable healthcare, as well as (<a href="https://www.mwell.com.ph/lgu-community" tabindex=18">self-reportedly</a>) both accreditation from the <abbr>D.O.H.</abbr> & partnerships with local government unit (<abbr title="local government unit">L.G.U</abbr>.)'s.</p>
    <strong>On Price-Ranges</strong>
    <p>All telemedicine services are priced in Philippine <span lang="fil-PH">peso</span>s ("<abbr title="Philippine peso">PHP</abbr>" or "<abbr title="Philippine peso">₱</abbr>"), usually around ₱500 per appointment. Given the exchange-rate from the <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph"><span lang="fil-PH">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</span> (<abbr title="Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas" tabindex="19">B.S.P.</abbr>)</a>, that can be some major savings (especially given prices here in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr>).</p>
    <strong>On Mental Health Appointments</strong>
    <p>For mental-health telemedicine appointments (in Tagalog, Cebuano, Chavacano, Hiligaynon, Maguindanao, Ilocano, Bicolano, etc.), they're (relatively) more expensive: priced ₱3,400; ₱2,050; ₱1,350; or ₱500. (I'm guessing, it's due to fewer specialists?) While the prices may be nicer, the <abbr>app</abbr> isn't very precise in terms of mental-health specialties. Still, they offer specialists from the <a href="https://www.pap.ph/" tabindex="20">Psychological Association of the Philippines (<abbr title="Psychological Association of the Philippines">P.A.P.</abbr>)</a>, <a href="https://philippinepsychiatricassociation.org/" tabindex="21">Philippine Psychiatric Association (<abbr title="Philippine Psychiatric Association">P.P.A.</abbr>)</a>, and the <a href="https://philippinepsychiatricassociation.org/" tabindex="22">Philippine Neurological Association (<abbr title="Philippine Neurological Association">P.N.A.</abbr>)</a>. Some have decades of experience, while most have a few years of experience. (Those with around 1-year of experience offer ₱500-appointments!)(</p>
