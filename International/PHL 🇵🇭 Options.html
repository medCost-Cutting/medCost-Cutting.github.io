  <h1>On Health-Insurance</h1>
    <h2>Back in the Philippines, the "<a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2019/02/20/republic-act-no-11223/">Universal Health Care Act</a>" (<a href="https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/86448">Republic Act 11223</a>) became law on 21 February 2019. So while private health-insurace options do exist, all PH citizens are declared to be members of the government owned or controlled corporation (G.O.C.C.) <a href="https://www.philhealth.gov.ph/">Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth)</a>. Of course, laws are more easily made than implemented, in a non-1st-world republic with a limited budget to administer over 7k-2k islands (depending on hightide or lowtide).</h2>
    <h2>To fill-in the gaps, the <a href="https://www.dswd.gov.ph/">Department of Social Welfare & Development (D.S.W.D.)</a> hosts "<a href="https://aics.dswd.gov.ph/malasakit-centers/"><span lang="fil-PH">Malasakit</span> Centers</a>" to provide further financial-support/"Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations (A.I.C.S.)", as best it can. The term <span lang="fil-PH">·úã·úé·úê·úÉ·úí·úÜ·úî</span> ("<span lang="fil-PH">malas√°kit</span>"; "mah-lah-SAH-kit"; n.„Äåsympathy„Äç) comes from the root-word <span lang="fil-PH">·úê·úÉ·úí·úÜ·úî</span>, which can mean either 1 thing ("<span lang="fil-PH">s√°kit</span>"; "SAH-kit"; n.„Äåempathy/sympathy„Äç) or another ("<span lang="fil-PH">sak√≠t</span>"; "sah-KIT"; n. „Äåpain/sickness/condition„Äç).</h2>
  <h1>On Alternative & Complementary Medicine</h1>
    <h2>The <a href="https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/3840">‚ÄúTraditional and Alternative Medicine Act (TAMA) of 1997‚Äù (Republic Act 8423)</a> was signed into law on 7 December 1997, creating the <a href="https://pitahc.gov.ph/about-pitahc/">Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (P.I.T.A.H.C.)</a>, a government owned or controlled corporation (G.O.C.C.) under the <a href="https://doh.gov.ph/">Department of Health (D.O.H.)</a>. As of 14 December 2024, there are 1,530 <a href="https://pitahc.gov.ph/list-of-certified-practitioners/">listed certified practitioners</a> & 119 <a href="https://pitahc.gov.ph/list-of-accredited-facilities-organizations/">listed accredited facilities/organizations</a>.</h2>
  <h1>On Medical Tourism</h1>
    <h2>A note: While medical-tourism to the Philippines is a thing (and here's a <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/philippines-healthcare">write-up about it from the U.S. Department of Commerce</a>), it's generally most advisable to seek treatment from facilities inside the National Capital Region (a.k.a. "Metro Manila"), like from <a href="https://www.stlukes.com.ph/international-patients/about-stlukes">St. Luke's Medical Center</a>, or in specilaist-centers in major-cities. Healthcare services in far-flung provincial areas may prove very basic.</h2>
  <h1>On Telemedicine (for Filipinos, Domestic & Abroad)</h1>
    <h2>Metro Pacific Investments Corp.'s "<a href="https://www.mwell.com.ph/">mWell PH</a>"-app has a <a href="https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/04/04/entertainment-lifestyle/life-times/health-app-govt-partner-for-ofws-global-healthcare/1885552">partnership</a> with the <a href="https://dmw.gov.ph/">Department of Migrant Workers (D.M.W.)</a> to ensure Filipinos EVERYWHERE can get affordable healthcare, as well as (<a href="https://www.mwell.com.ph/lgu-community">self-reportedly</a>) both accreditation from the <a href="https://doh.gov.ph/">Departent of Health (D.O.H.)</a> & partnerships with local government units (L.G.U.'s).</h2>
    <h3>On Price-Ranges</h3>
      <h4>All services are priced in Philippine <span lang="fil-PH">peso</span>s ("PHP" or "‚Ç±"), usually around ‚Ç±500 per appointment. Given the exchange-rate from the <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph"><span lang="fil-PH">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</span> (B.S.P.)</a>, that can be some major savings (especially given prices here in the U.S.).</h4>
    <h3>On Mental Health Appointments</h3>
      <h4>For mental-health appointments (in Tagalog, Cebuano, Chavacano, Hiligaynon, Maguindanao, Ilocano, Bicolano, etc.), they're (relatively) more expensive: priced ‚Ç±3,400; ‚Ç±2,050; ‚Ç±1,350; or ‚Ç±500. (I'm guessing it's due to fewer specialists?) While the prices may be nicer, the app isn't very precise in terms of mental-health specialties. Still, they offer specialists from the <a href="https://www.pap.ph/">Psychological Association of the Philippines (P.A.P.)</a>, <a href="https://philippinepsychiatricassociation.org/">Philippine Psychiatric Association (P.P.A.)</a>, and the <a href="https://philippinepsychiatricassociation.org/">Philippine Neurological Association (P.N.A.)</a>. Some have decades of experience, while most have a few years of experience. (Those with around 1-year of experience offer ‚Ç±500-appointments!)(</h4>
  <h1>For More‚Ä¶</h1>
    <h2>More info & services can be found the "Health"-section of the <a href="https://www.gov.ph/">PH Government</a>'s "<a href="https://www.gov.ph/services/">Services</a>"-page. And while still in its infancy, the new "<a href="https://e.gov.ph/">eGov PH</a>"-app should (soon) have everything government-related.</h2>
