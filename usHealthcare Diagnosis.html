     <p>Mr. Parnell noted the chargemaster being an issue in <abbr title="Self-Pay Patient">S.P.P.</abbr>-articles back in <time datetime="2013">2013</time> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140415223405/http://theselfpaypatient.com/2013/08/22/fixed-benefit-insurance-policies-an-alternative-to-comprehensive-insurance/">here</a> & <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140409053658/http://theselfpaypatient.com/2013/09/23/hospital-bills-student-2000-for-lab-test-insurer-pays-375/">here</a>), as well a year later (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200623034556/http://selfpaypatient.com/2014/09/03/must-read-op-ed-in-todays-wall-street-journal-health-care-and-the-20000-bruise/">here</a>). Apparently, it's still an issue, as reported by <cite>Reuters</cite> in <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, with <strong>my emphases added</strong>:</p>

       <blockquote>
         <p>The <strong>"list price" for healthcare treatments can vary wildly and may not reflect what will appear on a patient's bill</strong>, a new study finds.</p>
         <p>After reviewing listed prices for a particular therapy -- radiation treatments for prostate cancer -- researchers concluded that <strong>publicly-available price lists for cancer treatment may not help patients who want to shop around for the best deal</strong>.</p>
         <p><strong>Since 2019, hospitals have been required</strong> by the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> <a href="https://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> (<abbr title="Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services">CMS</abbr>) <strong>to post prices online for the services they offer</strong>, in what is called <strong>a chargemaster</strong>.</p>
         <p>"The prices we found were all over the map," said <abbr tile="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Trevor Royce, an assistant professor of radiation oncology at the <a href="https://www.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> and the study's senior author. "And they were much higher than what Medicare typically pays."</p>
         <p><strong>The point of making hospitals create a chargemaster was to facilitate comparison shopping and to foster competition</strong>, Royce said.</p>
         <p><strong>The problem</strong> with the system is that the <strong>list prices may not reflect what insurance companies are actually paying for services</strong>, Royce said. "They are <strong>not the true negotiated rates that the hospitals and insurance companies agree upon</strong>," he explained. "Those numbers might be <strong>more meaningful</strong>, but that is <strong>not what is listed publicly</strong> because they are considered to be <strong>proprietary</strong>."</p>
         <p>While the <strong><abbr>CMS</abbr> has tried to fix the problem by issuing a new rule that would force hospitals to post negotiated rates</strong>, that change may not be implemented any time soon, Royce said. "<strong>Several hospital groups have filed lawsuits in federal court to prevent it</strong> from becoming a reality," he added.</p>
         <p>To get a sense of whether the <abbr>CMS</abbr> rule mandating hospitals post prices would help patients, Royce and colleagues concentrated on a common treatment, radiation therapy for prostate cancer, and checked prices listed at National Cancer Institute designated cancer centers.</p>
         <p>As reported in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology"><cite><abbr title="Journal of the American Medical Association">JAMA</abbr> Oncology</cite></a>, of the 63 designated hospitals, 52 listed a price for the treatment the researchers were looking for. "We found <strong>prices were hard to find on websites and not at all uniform</strong>," Royce said.</p>
         <p>In fact, prices varied wildly, with the highest price 20 times that of the lowest: $399,056 versus $18,368. The average cost was $111,728.80, which is more than 10 times the $11,091 that Medicare pays.</p>
         <p>The wide variation in prices didn't surprise Amanda Starc, an associate professor of strategy at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/">Kellogg School of Management</a> at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> in Chicago.</p>
         <p><strong>What you'll pay generally depends on the deal your insurance company negotiated</strong>, said Starc, who wasn't involved in the study. But there is a group of consumers for whom the numbers may have more meaning: those without insurance.</p>
         <p><strong>Without an insurance company to negotiate, consumers can end up with a bill for the amount shown in the chargemaster</strong>, Starc said.</p>
